# mcp3424

Linux userspace I2C module for the MCP3424 ADC. Code was originally ported from the code found [here](https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python3_Libraries/tree/master/ADCPi). This has been used with ABElectronics' ADC Pi and ADC Pi Plus. See [main.c](main.c) for an example of how to use the module.


## Dependencies

This module depends on `libi2c-dev` which can be installed on debian by running `sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev`.


## Building and running

To compile main.c run:

```bash
make
```

to test run:

```bash
./main
```

Ensure that the device is correct for your adapter e.g. on Raspberry Pi Model A+ and Raspberry Pi 2 Model B the device is `/dev/i2c-1`.
